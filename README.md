## Project Description
The Akan Name Generator is a simple web application that calculates the day of the week a user was born and assigns them an Akan name based on Ghanaian cultural traditions. Akan names are given according to the day of birth and differ for males and females.

This project demonstrates the use of core JavaScript concepts such as functions, arrays, control flow, operators, and user input validation, alongside basic HTML and CSS.
